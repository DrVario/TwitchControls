## How to use
- Once all the prerequisites have been configured it is time to launch the program
- Open a nodejs terminal in the javascript folder
- When the terminal is open launch the node server using the command `node control.js`
- If the server launches sucessfully there should be a blank line with no errors

![A working run](./pictures/workingrun.png)
- When and only when the nodejs server is running is it time to launch Bizhawk

- Navigate to the EmuHawk.exe shortcut you made in the earlier steps
- Launch the EmuHawk.exe shortcut
- If there is an error that looks like the following picture make sure the nodejs server is started

![Bizhwk Error due to no server connection](./pictures/networkerror.png)

- Otherwise Bizhawk should launch and the lua console

![Bizhawk working](./pictures/bizworking.PNG)

- At this point load the rom of the game that you want played and click on the red box on the lua console to start the script
- If Everything is working a new message saying game starting should appear on the nodejs server window
